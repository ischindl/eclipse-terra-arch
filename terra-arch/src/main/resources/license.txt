3. PAYMENT
3.1 Fees - Most Subscription fees will be collected through the Order Form on the Terra Architect website.

Unless specified to the contrary in an Order Form, fees for any Renewal Term may be increased.
3.2 Payment Due Date - Payment from the Customer is due within thirty (30) days from the date of invoice unless otherwise stated in the invoice.

4. OWNERSHIP, RIGHTS & CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
4.1 Results - Customer agrees that KMF Enterprises may compile benchmarking results from Customers’ use of Terra Architect.  This anonymized data may be aggregated with other Customers’ data and disclosed for any purpose.


4.2 KMF Enterprises Ownership - Relevant to the relationship between Customer and KMF Enterprises, KMF Enterprises is the sole owner of all right, title, and interest (including, without limitation, all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to Terra Architect, including all copies, modifications, and derivative works thereof. Customer agrees that all rights, title, or interest to any Customer feedback, suggestions, comments, ideas, or requests for enhancements to Terra Architect are hereby consigned to KMF Enterprises, to be used for any purpose. KMF Enterprises remains the sole owner of any right not specifically ceded to Customer in this Agreement.
4.3 Terra Architect License – Customer acknowledges that they are receiving a limited license right to Terra Architect and that regardless of the word “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms in the Order Form or Agreement, no ownership rights are being transferred to Customer under this Agreement or otherwise. Subject to payment in full to KMF Enterprise as specified in an Order Form, KMF Enterprise grants Customer a royalty free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, time-bounded license to use, for Customer's internal business purposes only and subject to the terms of this Agreement, Terra Architect as included in Subscriptions, maintenance and Services. For use in connection with Subscriptions and Services, the term of Customer's permitted use will be the duration of the Subscription.                           
4.4 Confidential Information - Customer acknowledges that all information it obtains (“Recipient”) from the disclosing party (“Discloser”) is the confidential property of the Discloser, provided that it is designated as “Confidential”, “Proprietary,” or a similar written designation, or should be reasonably known by the Recipient to be Confidential Information due to the nature of the information disclosed. Any oral communication will be considered Confidential Information if the information is identified as Confidential Information at the time of disclosure. The following is defined as Confidential Information in the absence of any written confirmation or labels: (a) Terra Architect, product and service information, pricing information, and other related materials furnished by KMF Enterprises; (b) the Subscription environment and tools, materials, documentation, whitepapers, guides, data sheets, training materials, methodology and (c) the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This Agreement imposes no obligation upon a Recipient with respect to Confidential Information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available through no breach of this Agreement by Recipient; (b) is already in the possession of Recipient at the time of disclosure as shown by Recipient's files and records immediately before the time of disclosure; (c) is obtained by Recipient from a third party without obligation of confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to Discloser's Confidential Information, as demonstrated by Recipient's documents.  
4.5 Confidential Information Handling - Recipient agrees to use Discloser’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care that Recipient uses to guard its own confidential or proprietary information from unauthorized use, disclosure, or distribution.  
Recipient will restrict access to Discloser's Confidential Information to Recipient's employees and Consultants who require such access in the course of their assigned duties and responsibilities.  If Discloser's Confidential Information is required to be disclosed under any law or judicial order, Recipient will (to the extent permitted by law) give Discloser prompt notice thereof and use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek or cooperate with Discloser in seeking a protective order at Discloser's request and expense. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.
5. CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS
5.1 Customer Responsibilities - Customers must administer and monitor the confidentiality and use of license keys provided to Authorized Administrators within the Subscription by KMF Enterprises.

8. WARRANTY                           
8.1 Limited Subscription Warranty - KMF Enterprises warrants that for a period of thirty (30) days from the Activation Date the Subscription will operate in substantial conformity to the then-current Terra Architect product documentation included in the Subscription. KMF Enterprises does not guarantee that Customer’s use of Terra Architect will be uninterrupted or error-free, will not result in data loss, or that any security mechanisms used by Terra Architect will not have inherent limitations. KMF Enterprises does not warrant that the Subscription or the data stored through the use of the Subscription are not susceptible to attack, intrusion, or computer virus infection. This warranty does not apply if the Subscription is not administered by Customer in accordance with this Agreement, or any applicable instructions and training provided by KMF Enterprises. If the Subscription fails to operate as warranted in this Section 8.1 and Customer notifies KMF Enterprises in writing of the nature of the non-conformance (“Notice”), KMF Enterprises will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with an error-correction or work-around which corrects the non-conformity, or to promptly repair or replace the non-conforming Software with conforming Software. If, after a reasonable opportunity to cure, KMF Enterprises does not remedy the non-conformance, Customer may no later than sixty (60) days after giving the Notice, terminate the Subscription portion of the Order Form and receive a refund of the prepaid Subscription fees for the period following the date of Notice. The foregoing provides Customer's sole remedy for breach of the exclusive warranty in this Section 8.1.
8.2 Exclusions – The above warranty is not applicable: (a) if Terra Architect is used with hardware not specified in the documentation; (b) if Terra Architect is modified by Customer or any third-party; (c) if there are defects in Terra Architect due to accident, abuse, or improper use by Customer; or (d) to items provided free of charge.
8.3 Services Warranty - KMF Enterprises warrants that all Services performed hereunder will be performed in a workmanlike and professional manner.

9. TERM OF AGREEMENT                  
9.1 Term - This Agreement is effective as of the Activation Date and expires on the day that the Subscription Terms for Terra Architect licensed hereunder have expired. At the end of the Initial Term, this Agreement will automatically renew for consecutive renewal terms equal to twelve (12) months in length (each, a “Renewal Term”), unless either party gives the other party a written notice of termination at least sixty (60) days before expiration of the Initial Term or the then-current Renewal Term. Either party may terminate this Agreement (including all related Order Forms) if the other party: (a) fails to cure a material breach of this Agreement within thirty (30) days of written notice thereof, (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) files a petition for bankruptcy or insolvency, files for the appointment of a receiver, or is adjudicated a bankrupt concern, or if such proceeding is instituted against such party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).

9.2 Effect of Termination - Upon termination of this Agreement or termination of a Subscription or Service, as the case may be, Customer shall cease any and all use of Terra Architect and destroy all copies thereof, except for reasonable electronic backup copies kept under normal business proceedings that are subject to reasonable document destruction procedures. KMF Enterprises may immediately cease providing any such terminated Subscription or Service and Customer's rights to use Terra Architect will cease.

9.3 Survival - The provisions of Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.4, 9, and 10 will survive termination or expiration of the Agreement.

10.1 Assignment - Customer shall not assign this Agreement (or any part therein) without the advance written consent of KMF Enterprises, except in connection with Customer’s merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of Customer’s assets or voting securities.

Customer will assume all costs involved in mediation. The use of any of the above-mentioned procedures will not be construed under the doctrines of laches, waiver, or estoppel to affect the rights of either party adversely.

10.8 Force Majeure - Except for Customer’s payment obligations, neither party shall be liable to the other party for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this agreement if such delay or failure arises from events beyond the reasonable control of such other party. Such causes include, but are not limited to, acts of God, floods, fires, strike, blockade, war, acts of terrorism, riot, loss of electricity or other utilities, refusal of approval or a license by a government agency, or delays by Customer in providing required resources or support or performing any other requirements hereunder.
